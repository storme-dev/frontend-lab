# Landing Page

The task is pretty obvious. It's just for slow start for you 😉.<br/>
So you need to create Landing Page which will looks like this one: [Here will be url](https://itechart-interns-landing.herokuapp.com/) - needs some time to be loaded.

### The requirements to the task:

- write on plenty HTML, CSS, JS (withount any libraries/frameworks)
- the page should be fully responsive like in the example
- for the cards in the section <em>AND HERE ARE SOME IMAGES FOR YOU</em> use `flex`
- images can take from the example
- use `Roboto Slab` font famaly where it necessary (it's a custom one)
- all animations should be done using ONLY CSS/JS
- JS have to be written on the latest standarts (ES6+)
- it should looks good in the latest version of moder browsers (at least Chrome, Firefox)
- go to `workflow` folder, create `landing-page` folder and work on it
- 📛 don't copy code of the example
