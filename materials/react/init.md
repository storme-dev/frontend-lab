# Getting Started 

First step is to set up your environment
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- Use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) to install [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) as a global package
- Init a project (*YOUR_REPO/workflow/react-project*)
- Launch it to be sure it works
- Enjoy yourself a little bit 💪
- Add your first component called *CurrentTime*, which displays the current time(HH:MM:SS format), time should be updated every second
- Place *\<CurrentTime\/\>* somewhere inside of default *\<App\/\>* component (ensure it is visible)
- Great job! You have your own React project running! See the next task
